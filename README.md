# Asian Language Map


## Introduction

This is a website to provide a linguistic overview on Asia, and hopefully share some knowledge about the language diversity over Asian countries.  

The motivation behind this site is simple, I realized many people are not aware of the language diversity in Asia, especially as the most populated continent in the world, there is a great deal about the languages people spoke in Asia. 

There are over 2,300 languages people speaking in Asia<sup>1</sup>, some countries has over 100 native languages, and some people from 1 country are all trilingual. Many interesting facts behind the Asian languages are not well-known to people. 

The major function of this site is an interactive map, where user can click any country on the map, and a detail description of the country's language information will pop up on the side. 

## Bootstrap

Used Bootstrap 4.5 JS and CSS for styling, responsive design, and interactivity. 

Custom JS in the Asia map to display language information when change in country selection from user  

## Notes

There are many aspects of this site can be further improved, possibly a backend server can create more functionality on the map. 

Detail description of language are yet to be filled, as a credible source over all Asian languages is somewhat hard to find on the web.
